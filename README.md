# Train and Deploy Machine Learning Models on Amazon SageMaker

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that provides a comprehensive guide on training and deploying machine learning or Hugging Face models on Amazon SageMaker.

In the notebook, you will find step-by-step instructions and code examples for:

Setting up the SageMaker environment and configuring resources
Preparing data for training and inference
Building and training machine learning models using popular frameworks
Evaluating model performance and making predictions
Deploying trained models on SageMaker endpoints for real-time inference
Managing and monitoring deployed endpoints
Scaling and optimizing model training and inference
The notebook is designed to help you understand the end-to-end workflow of training and deploying ML models on SageMaker, providing practical examples and best practices. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this resource will assist you in leveraging the power of SageMaker for your machine-learning projects.

Additionally, if you already have pre-trained model files, the notebook also includes code snippets on how to create an endpoint for deploying these pre-trained models on SageMaker. This allows you to easily make use of your existing models without the need for retraining.

Feel free to explore the notebook, experiment with the code, and adapt it to your specific use cases. If you find it useful, please consider giving it a star or sharing it with others.

Happy learning and building with Amazon SageMaker!
